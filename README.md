# Shoeboxing-algorithm
This repository contains the script of the implementation of a simplification shoeboxing algorithm for Urban and Building Energy Modeling. The algorithm coverts a building of any shape into a representative shoebox to speed-up the simulation task of Urban and Building Energy Modeling as presented in the image below:
